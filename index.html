<h2 class="text-white"><strong>Meet SmartDucksWorks, your home&rsquo;s environmental savior.</strong></h2>

<p>SmartDucksWorks ensures a balanced, cost-effective and green ecosystem on every floor with remarkable innovative hardware and software integration. Your home will be handled 24/7 by sensors installed in our SmartDucks, allowing a more even distribution of the temperature/mositure and healthier indoor environment with your current HVAC system. Ensuring optimal comfort and energy efficiency all year round.</p>

<p>We believe that your home&rsquo;s health and comfort come above all. That&rsquo;s why our SmartDucks detect inefficiencies in your HVAC system and adjust airflow accordingly for optimal living experience. Our witty algorithms monitor, learn, and adapt to the indoor and outdoor environments continuously. SmartDucks will even suggest thermostat setting, so you can focus on what matters most while your home is taken care of.</p>

<p>Let us help you improve the environment you spend so much time in and that contains all that is precious to you.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>All thermostats struggle for balance.</strong></h2>

          <p>There are <strong><em>limitations</em></strong> to heating/cooling your ecosystem with any <em>HVAC</em>. The most obvious are the inability to heat/cool your ecosystem evenly and control mositure. Our <strong><em>SmartDucks</em></strong> were scientifically hatched with imprinted machine learning to <strong><em>solve these problems and more.</em></strong></p>
          
          <p>Traditional HVAC systems are an all-or-nothing technology for your ecosystem. They cycle on at full capacity or ramp up under a smart thermostat and blast you with heated/cooled air until the desired setting is reached or beyond at the location of the master sensor. Then, they cycle off, some modern ones run a fan a little longer to grab a little extra for you. Yet various parts of your home stay at different temps, with different moisture levels and are constantly in flux  due time of year, sunlight, activity within and outside your home environment. This downside of HVAC, smart/ordinary themostats is an ongoing variance in indoor/outdoor environments and total denial of how this influences inefficient distribution throughout. And they claim they are saving you money - at what cost? What about your health? Your ecosystem is a mess.</p>

<p>SmartDucks help redirect that air to balance your environment efficiently 24/7. SmartDucks do not control your furnace or air conditioner. They work to balance your HVAC flaws to your benefit. This creates an even temperature distribution throughout your home, abolishing hot or cold spots, controls moisture and maintains consistent comfort and health. Your ecosystem will feel like a real home. Cozy.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>Real-Time Every Day</strong></h2>
      <p>Fortunately, SmartDucks are very energy efficient, each running on a single rechargeable battery that lasts for a very long flight. They pull sensor data every few minutes and compare with your external location environment and adjust airflow with the goal of complete ecosystem balance on a location by location basis. These SmartDucks use mind melding machine learning to constantly adapt to your environmental situation all day, every day of the year and correct for inaccuracy of location and indoor/outdoor environments and various realities. No single setting will ever provide you comfort since weather is not constant nor is your ecosystem with critters, kids, water bowls, plants, showers, doors and windows. Sometimes to achieve your goal SmartDucks may even suggest a thermostat setting for you and work to keep the load off your ecosystem conserving energy.</p>

      <p>SmartDucks work hard with your HVAC in a symbiotic relationship, automatically redirecting of airflow balancing your ecosystem efficiently. This is achieved by easily inserting a SmartDuck into each end-point of your HVAC system under your nests (floor vents). Our simple SmartDucks system simplifies this process, just snap in place, enabling you to keep your existing nest coverings (floor vent covers), and will work with any thermostat and HVAC system and your wifi (2.4 GHz).</p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>SmartDucks Efficiency 24/7</strong></h2>

<p>SmartDucks commnicate with each other and their colleagues back on the pond (lab) and various services connected to the web to stay on top of constant changes surrounding your ecosystem. SmartDucks are reasonably priced, balance the environment with your ecosystem offering opportunity for energy savings and better health, which is good for everyone. Your return on your SmartDucks investment is high.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, thermostats do not care that your health might be suffering. SmartDucks take advantage of this and can manipulate when your system achieves itâ€™s goal to better balance your ecosystem. SmartDucks are for your comfort and health above all other things.</p>

<p>When SmartDucks are ordered you can even add your home router SSID/password (guest network if you prefer) that  we never see but is instantly written to each of your SmartDucks to guarantee success on arrival.</p>

<h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>Feather Brains Responsible</strong></h2>
  
<p>So a couple neighbourhood ducks hatched an idea. They found like minded quackers and after a lot of pond talk and snails an idea was hatched. One duck was lost, that&rsquo;s another tail.</p>

<p>After alot of scientific testing and unbelievably expensive technology developed and resources harnessed, the first SmartDuck hatched.</p>

<p>It was an epic time of edge computing, machine learning, AI and feathers, lots of feathers.</p>

<p>Nothing dire happned, no nuclear holocost, no robot wars, so it was decided to let SmartDucks loose on the world.</p>
