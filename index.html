<h2 class="text-white"><strong>Everything is in place.</strong></h2>

<p>The water is perfect. Our nests are made. We are going to help take back control of your ecosystem and save the environment. There are <strong><em>limitations</em></strong> to heating your ecosystem with any <em>HVAC</em>. The most obvious are the inability to heat your ecosystem evenly and mositure. Our <strong><em>SmartDucks</em></strong> were scientifically hatched with imprinted machine learning to <strong><em>solve these problems and more.</em></strong></p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>All thermostats struggle for balance.</strong></h2>
<p>Traditional HVAC systems are an all-or-nothing technology for your ecosystem. They cycle on at full capacity or ramp up under a smart thermostat and blast you with heated/cooled air until the desired setting is reached at the location of the master sensor. Then, they cycle off, some modern ones run a fan a little longer to grab a little extra for you. Yet various parts of your home stay at different temps, with different moisture levels. This downside of HVAC, smart/ordinary themostats is an ongoing variance in indoor/outdoor environments and total denial of how this influences inefficient distribution throughout. And they claim they are saving you money - at what cost? Your ecosystem is a mess.</p>

<p>SmartDucks help redirect that air to balance your environment efficiently 24/7. SmartDucks do not control your furnace or air conditioner. They work to balance your HVAC flaws to your benefit. This creates an even temperature distribution throughout your home, abolishes hot and cold spots, controls moisture and maintains consistent comfort and health. Your ecosystem will feel like a home.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>Real-Time Every Day</strong></h2>
<p>Fortunately, SmartDucks are very energy efficient, each running on a single rechargeable battery that lasts for a very long flight. They pull sensor data every few minutes and compare with your external location environment and adjust airflow with the goal of complete ecosystem balance on a location by location basis. These SmartDucks use mind melding machine learning to constantly adapt to your environmental situation all day, every day of the year and correct for inaccuracy of location and indoor/outdoor environments and various realities. No single setting will ever provide you comfort since weather is not constant nor is your ecosystem with critters, kids, water bowls, plants, doors and windows. Sometimes to achieve your goal SmartDucks may even suggest a thermostat setting for you and work to keep the load off your ecosystem conserving energy.</p>

<p>SmartDucks work hard with your HVAC in a symbiotic and  automatic redirecting of airflow balancing your ecosystem efficiently. This is achieved by easily inserting a SmartDuck into each end-point of your HVAC system under your nests (floor vents). Our simple SmartDucks system simplifies this process, just snap in place, enabling you to keep your existing nest coverings (floor vent covers), and will work with any thermostat and HVAC system and your wifi.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>SmartDucks Efficiency 24/7</strong></h2>

<p>SmartDucks are easy to position throughout your ecosystem, they just snap into the vent where it meets the main duct work. SmartDucks consume very little battery energy and don’t require wiring, keep installation quick and easy. SmartDucks commnicate with each other and their colleagues back on the pond (lab) and various services connected to the web to stay on top of constant changes surrounding your ecosystem. SmartDucks are reasonably priced, balance the environment with your ecosystem offering opportunity for energy savings, which is good for everyone. Your return on your SmartDucks investment is high. Wayward SmartDucks can be returned to the pond (lab) for 100% recycling at any point in time. No SmartDuck left behind!</p>

<p>Longer and slower HVAC running times take ecosystem air on many more passes through air filtration decreasing the presence of airborne contaminants in your ecosystem that SmartDucks monitor. These cycles help remove more humidity from indoor air, which reduces the load on your heating and cooling components and thereby generates less wear for a lasting pleasent ecosystem. Unfortunately, thermostats do not care that your health might be suffering. SmartDucks take advantage of this and can manipulate when your system achieves it’s goal to better balance your ecosystem. SmartDucks are for your comfort and health above all other things.</p>
