    <h2>The Story Behind SmartDucks</h2>
    <div class="centered-content">
      <p>So a couple neighbourhood ducks hatched an idea. They found like minded quackers and after a lot of pond talk and snails an idea was hatched. One duck was lost, that’s another tail.
        After a lot of scientific testing and unbelievably expensive technology developed and resources harnessed, the first SmartDuck hatched.
        It was an epic time of edge computing, machine learning, AI and feathers, lots of feathers.
        Nothing dire happened, no radiation cloud, no robot wars, so it was decided to let SmartDucks loose on the world. What could go wrong?</p>
