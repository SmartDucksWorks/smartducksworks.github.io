<h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>All thermostats struggle for balance.</strong></h2>
<p>Traditional HVAC systems are an all-or-nothing technology for your ecosystem. They cycle on at full capacity or ramp up under a smart thermostat and blast you with heated/cooled air until the desired setting is reached at the location of the master sensor. Then, they cycle off, some modern ones run a fan a little longer to grab a little extra for you. Yet various parts of your home stay at different temps, with different moisture levels. This downside of HVAC, smart/ordinary themostats is an ongoing variance in indoor/outdoor environments and total denial of how this influences inefficient distribution throughout. And they claim they are saving you money - at what cost? Your ecosystem is a mess.</p>
