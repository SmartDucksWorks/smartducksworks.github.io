<h2 class="text-white text-white"><strong>All Our Products Are Made Locally</strong></h2>

<p>SmartDucks are designed in Canada and manufactured locally in USA and Canada. Shipped from the closest micro-manufacturing (LAMPS) location to you with sufficient inventory at the time you order.</p>

<p>SmartDucks lured Stripe into helping you purchase directly from our pond with security. All of your shopping here will be a fun and safe experience. Donâ€™t even look at the Bullfrogs.</p>

<p>If you experience any difficulties, you can always address our Ruffled Feathers department.</p>

<p>SmartDucks ship directly to your doorstep. We currently use United States Postal Service and Canada Post with full flight tracking.</p>

<p>Wayward SmartDucks can be returned to the pond (lab) for 100% recycling (deep frying) at any point in time. No SmartDuck left behind!</p>
