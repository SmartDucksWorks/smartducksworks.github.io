<p>Fortunately, SmartDucks are very energy efficient, each running on a single rechargeable battery that lasts for a very long flight. They pull sensor data every few minutes and compare with your external location environment and adjust airflow with the goal of complete ecosystem balance on a location by location basis. These SmartDucks use mind melding machine learning to constantly adapt to your environmental situation all day, every day of the year and correct for inaccuracy of location and indoor/outdoor environments and various realities. No single setting will ever provide you comfort since weather is not constant nor is your ecosystem with critters, kids, water bowls, plants, showers, doors and windows. Sometimes to achieve your goal SmartDucks may even suggest a thermostat setting for you and work to keep the load off your ecosystem conserving energy.</p>

<p>SmartDucks work hard with your HVAC in a symbiotic relationship, automatically redirecting of airflow balancing your ecosystem efficiently. This is achieved by easily inserting a SmartDuck into each end-point of your HVAC system under your nests (floor vents). Our simple SmartDucks system simplifies this process, just snap in place, enabling you to keep your existing nest coverings (floor vent covers), and will work with any thermostat and HVAC system and your wifi (2.4 GHz).</p>
