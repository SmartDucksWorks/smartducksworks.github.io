<p>So a couple neighbourhood ducks hatched an idea. They found like minded quackers and after a lot of pond talk and snails an idea was hatched. One duck was lost, that's another tail.</p>

<p>After alot of scientific testing and unbelievably expensive technology developed and resources harnessed, the first SmartDuck hatched.</p>

<p>It was an epic time of edge computing, machine learning, AI and feathers, lots of feathers.</p>

<p>Nothing dire happned, no nuclear holocost, no robot wars, so it was decided to let SmartDucks loose on the world.</p>
